# 3D, S3D and S3D® : What are the differences ?

As far as the VISUALIZATION is concerned the use of the term “3D“ very often is misleading or at least end-user (= potential customer !!!) could understand it in a misleading way. Especially in the DDC (Digital Content Creation) area “3D“ normally does just express the use of 3-dimentional object models or data, however in most of the cases the visualization is possible ONLY in 2D!

One example for such a “flat 3D visualization” are "3D graphics".

“**S3D**” (without trademark indication) can have different meanings or interpretations.

Lutz Moehr does use "S3D" in relation to the entirety of human "**Senses**, which enable the perception in 3D". Such senses are mainly Seeing and Hearing, but could be also Haptics (Touching).

On the international platform "S3D" is <u>often, but not (!) in very case</u>, used as a GENERAL indicator of a “**Stereoscopic 3D visualization related matter**”, what means that finally 2 (slightly different) images for the left and right eye could be generated.

<mark>“S3D®” as trademark for concrete products and services</mark> has been **registered in Germany since <u>2006 by Lutz Moehr</u>** and will be primarily used as **QUALITY label** and REFERENCE level – not least with the intention to help end-user to be able to recognize good quality products (first of all content) and services.

**Companies and private people are welcome** to apply to DNS Consult (Lutz Moehr) for **licensing the “S3D®”** trademark for their products and services for the German market.
