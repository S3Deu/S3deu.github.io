# Why will „Stereo-3D“ be the market of the future ?

Not only the IT-world is looking for new markets and new products to boost buyers´ demand. The rapid “DotCom” euphoria was followed by an exaggerated pessimism with regard to new technologies.

**„Stereo-3D“ has the potential to boost products that will enthuse.**

Today large parts of the puzzle already exist (hardware, software and content) to be able to put together effective Stereo-3D systems.

**The digital age**, which has just begun, opens new inconceivable dimensions concerning the posibilities to set-up, process and distribute Stereo-3D content.

Once the Stereo-3D content exists in digital form, the same content can be watched in all Stereo-3D techniques, which is decisive for an optimal and flexible use and in consequence most important for marketing.

The quality of viewing technologies for Stereo-3D content today ranges from a beginner level (with unbeatable cost-benefit-ratio) to professional ideas with VR-ambitions.

The **near future** will allow further quality improvement and respectively reduction of expenses of basiccomponents through technological progress (such as smaller dotpich, higher computer performance, higher frequency range and more bits per second).
