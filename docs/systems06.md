**SYSTEMS:**  
Over the past few years SYSTEMS has developed into an exhibition with a clear-cut profile: It is where the ICT industry "goes to work" and it addresses decision-makers in small and medium-sized enterprises and major corporations alike. The focus on "best practice" solutions and services for ICT-optimized business processes is primarily oriented to decision-makers.
