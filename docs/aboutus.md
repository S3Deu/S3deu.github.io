## About Us

### ”As the tree so the fruit..“

Our competence is based on over 35 years of professional experience in the sector of business develoment, especially in IT and display technologies of the **owner Lutz Moehr** as well as on his, some times, special experiences with the different cultures of the world.

Born in 1962 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (that time "Eastern Germany") Lutz Moehr graduated from High School in Halle/Salle with the qualification to enter university. During his studies and the PhD he experienced 8 years of Romania “live”. In October 1989 did break off his PhD and did escape – via Hungary - into the free Western Germany.

In his dynamic professional life Lutz Moehr not only got to know various European mentalities but also gained interesting experience among others cultures in the USA and Asia (e.g. by more than 20 business trips to Japan within 8 years for SONY).

Lutz Moehr did hold various management positions within SONY Europe (1991-1998) and ELSA AG (1999/2000). His engineering background has been combined with broad practical experience about all elements of the whole product supply chain and life cycle: from the product conception over production, support, marketing and sales up to profit and loss responsibilities.

DNS Consult, as an independent IT consulting company, has been founded in 2001.
